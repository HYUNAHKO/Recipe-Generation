## Introduction
"Armchair Chef" leverages AI technologies like image detection and knowledge graphs to recommend high-quality recipes based on limited ingredients. This project reminds us data collection is crucial part of making advanced AI. 

## Pipeline

## Model Training and Data
The fine-tuning of the YOLOv5 model was conducted using a custom dataset available on Hugging Face:
- **Model**: [YOLOv5 Fine-tuned Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yourusername/yolov5-finetuned)
- **Dataset**: [Labeled Image Data on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yourusername/yourdataset)

## Pipeline Overview
Our project follows a comprehensive pipeline from data gathering to final recipe suggestions:
1. **Dataset Preparation**
2. **Image Detection with YOLOv5**
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
4. **KAPING Integration**
5. **Prompt Engineering**
6. **Result Compilation**
